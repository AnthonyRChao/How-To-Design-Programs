This repo is a collection of code and other things as I progress through "How to Design Programs, Second Edition".

I don't remember how I first came upon this material, but the more I started reading, the more interested I became. Some quotes that encapsulate the author's philosphy below:

"The typical course on programming teaches a “tinker until it works” approach. When it works, students exclaim “It works!” and move on. Sadly, this phrase is also the shortest lie in computing, and it has cost many people many hours of their lives. In contrast, this book focuses on habits of good programming, addressing both professional and vocational programmers.

With “good programming,” we mean an approach to the creation of software that relies on systematic thought, planning, and understanding from the very beginning, at every stage and for every step. To emphasize the point, we speak of systematic program design and systematically designed programs. Critically, the latter articulates the rationale of the desired functionality. Good programming also satisfies an aesthetic sense of accomplishment; the elegance of a good program is comparable to time-tested poems or the black-and-white photographs of a bygone era. In short, programming differs from good programming like crayon sketches in a diner from oil paintings in a museum."

"People often tell us they wish they knew how to program and then ask which programming language they should learn. Given the press that some programming languages get, this question is not surprising. But it is also wholly inappropriate.

[...] learning to design programs is primarily about the study of principles and the acquisition of transferable skills."

"1. analyze a problem statement, typically stated as a word problem;
2. extract and express its essence, abstractly and with examples;
3. make outlines and plans based on this analysis;
4. evaluate results with respect to expected outcomes; and
5. revise the product in light of failed checks and tests."
