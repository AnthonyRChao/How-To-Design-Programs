; Exercise 25. Take a look at this attempt to solve exercise 17:

(define (image-classify img)
  (cond
    [(> (image-height img) (image-width img))
     "tall"]
    [(= (image-height img) (image-width img))
     "square"]
    [(< (image-height img) (image-width img))
     "wide"]))

(image-classify (circle 3 "solid" "red"))

; Does the stepping suggest how to fix this attempt?

; 6/8/17 How do you determine if the object is not a circle? Right now, a square and circle can have identical outputs
