; "year 2000" problem

; The Y2K problem was a problem that happened because of the way early computers were made. They were made to handle two digits (e.g. '92 instead of 1992) and the transition from December 31, 1999 to January 1, 2000 was thought to potentially lead to industry / system wide issues.

; It just so happened that the issue did not cause any widespread problems. Per wikipedia, it was either fixed in time or overstated from the start.
